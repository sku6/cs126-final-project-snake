* Why do you want to do this project?
    * I have always liked the game snake but I want to make
    my own version of this classic game
      
* background knowledge
    * basic boundary knowledge from the ideal gas assigment

* Timeline
    * Week 1
        * Create container boundaries that stops the after snake collied with it
        * Create snake
        * Use keyboard to move the snake
    * Week 2
        * Make the snake move by itself 
        * Create Treat that randomly pops up, 
          use cute image online
        * Extend the length of the snake if it eats a treat
        * Create a score board
        * Ends the game if the snake touches its' body
    * Week 3
        * Create Obstacles that randomly pops up
          * Deduct points when hit an obstacle
        * Game ends if score is 0    
        * Speeds up the game after 15 points
            * Treat disappears faster
            * Obstacle stays in the container for longer
        * Test cases to make sure the game runs smoothly  
* Stretch goals
    * Create different sizes of treats
    * Instead of using a rectangle to represent the snake,
    try importing cute pictures online
      * This might be hard since I need to extend the length
        of the snake after it gets a treat
    * Create a leader board that saves all the game scores
